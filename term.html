            <h3>The Ticketing Terms</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> Each Ticket gotten through the Digital Forms on IB Plc Platforms that IB Plc will share is intended to
                    give you a revocable license (or right) to enter and attendance of the particular Event only to which the
                    Ticket pertains. Each Ticket holder has a right to a seat or standing place in relation to the stage, of a
                    value corresponding to that stated on the Ticket holder&#8217;s Ticket. IB Plc and the Venue reserve the right to
                    provide alternative seats or standing places to those specified on the Ticket. </li>
                <li> A Ticket does not afford the Ticket holder the right to transport to the Venue or parking, merchandise,
                    or any food or beverages at the Venue unless otherwise stated. Other independent service providers
                    might render services relating to transport, parking, merchandise, food, or beverages at the Venue, and in
                    such circumstances, the terms and conditions of such service providers will apply between it and persons
                    who make use of such products or services. </li>
                <li> You must produce a valid Ticket to gain entry to the Venue and you must produce that Ticket for
                    inspection upon request from an Event official at any time. Failure to produce such a Ticket when
                    requested may result in you being denied access to the Venue or in you being removed from the Venue. </li>
                <li> Tickets are not transferable and cannot be resold or offered for resale (including online auction sites) or
                    used for commercial purposes including advertising, competitions, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or
                    used, sold, or given away in conjunction with other products or services (such as part of a travel or
                    hospitality package) without the express written permission of IB Plc in advance. If this condition is
                    breached the Ticket may be cancelled without compensation and the bearer of the Ticket may be refused
                    entry or removed from the Venue. </li>
                <li> Any Tickets bought from unauthorized agents or third parties are not valid and admission to an Event
                    on the strength of such Tickets will not be permitted. All Tickets remain the property of IB Plc at all times
                    and constitute a personal revocable license from IB Plc to the Ticket holder which may be withdrawn by
                    IB Plc and admission refused at any. </li>
                <li> We reserve the right to restrict the sale of Tickets to a maximum number per person, per credit/debit
                    card, and/or per household/organization and to cancel any Tickets in excess of this number. </li>
                <li> It is your responsibility to (i) ensure that your Tickets are collected by or delivered to you before the
                    date of the Event; (ii) keep your Tickets safe prior to the Event; and (iii) check your Tickets and to
                     ascertain the date and the time of the Event and if applicable, any rescheduled Event. Event dates and
                    times are subject to change. IB Plc is not responsible or liable should you fail to obtain your Tickets
                    timeously or for any Tickets that are lost, stolen, or damaged. </li>
                <li> Your possession of Tickets is subject to our right to cancel or reschedule an Event at any time, or to
                    alter or vary the program of an Event, due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control. Where we
                    alter or vary the programme of an Event, we shall not be obligated to refund any Ticket monies or
                    exchange your Tickets. Please note that if an opening act or guest artist is changed or cancelled, the
                    event is not considered cancelled and you will not be entitled to a refund or exchange. We shall have no
                    liability to you for the price of a Ticket in circumstances where an Event is cancelled due to circumstances
                    beyond our reasonable control. </li>
                <li> If an Event is rescheduled or cancelled, we will use our reasonable endeavours to notify you as soon
                    as reasonably possible thereof(including notifying you of the details of any rescheduled Event) by
                    publishing the details of the rescheduled or cancelled Event, as the case may be, by e-mail and/or short
                    message service (“SMS”) notification to the contact details which you provide at the time of the obtaining
                    of Tickets. It is therefore important that you provide us (whichever is applicable) with your correct contact
                    details at the time of winning the ticket of Tickets. </li>
                <li> The following restrictions will apply to your attendance at an Event and your breach of any of these
